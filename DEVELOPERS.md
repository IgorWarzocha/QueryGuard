# QueryGuard: Developer Guide

**Version 0.1.x (Reflecting recent updates)**

Welcome to the QueryGuard Developer Guide! This document provides comprehensive information for developers on setting up, integrating, understanding, and contributing to the QueryGuard library.

QueryGuard is a Python library designed to act as a crucial first line of defense for applications leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). It pre-processes user inputs to detect and mitigate common abuse patterns *before* the input reaches your primary LLM.

**Project Status: Alpha**
QueryGuard is currently in the alpha stage of development. The API is stabilizing, but the feature set is still evolving. Feedback and contributions are highly welcome!

For a general overview for non-developers, please see the main [README.md](README.md).

## 1. Core Concepts & Goals

* **Pre-LLM Filter:** QueryGuard analyzes user input *before* it's sent to an LLM.
* **Abuse Mitigation:** Aims to detect and mitigate common abuse patterns, instruction injections, data exfiltration attempts, and resource exhaustion strategies.
* **Configurable:** Highly configurable through external YAML rule files.
* **Lightweight & Fast:** Designed for minimal performance overhead.

---

## 2. Prerequisites and Environment Setup

* **Python:** QueryGuard requires Python 3.8 or newer.
* **Git (Conditional):** If you plan to install QueryGuard directly from a Git repository URL (e.g., in a `requirements.txt` file), you **must** have Git installed and accessible in your system's PATH. This is a common requirement for `pip` to handle Git-based dependencies.
* **Virtual Environments:** It is **strongly recommended** to use Python virtual environments (e.g., `venv`, `conda`) for any project incorporating QueryGuard. This isolates dependencies and prevents conflicts.
    ```bash
    # Example using venv
    python -m venv my_project_env
    source my_project_env/bin/activate  # On Windows: my_project_env\Scripts\activate
    ```

---

## 3. QueryGuard Installation

QueryGuard's dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt` (primarily `PyYAML` and `fuzzywuzzy`).

### Option A: From a Git Repository

You can install QueryGuard directly from its Git repository. Add the following line to your `requirements.txt` file:

```text
git+[https://github.com/igorwarzocha/queryguard-library.git@main#egg=queryguard](https://github.com/igorwarzocha/queryguard-library.git@main#egg=queryguard)
```

*(Note: Replace `@main` with a specific tag or commit hash for stable versions if available.)*

Then, run the installation command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Important:** This method requires Git to be installed and accessible in your system's PATH.

### Option B: Local Editable Install (for Development/Debugging QueryGuard)

If you are actively developing QueryGuard or need to debug its internals within a host application:
1.  Clone the QueryGuard repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/igorwarzocha/queryguard-library.git](https://github.com/igorwarzocha/queryguard-library.git)
    cd queryguard-library
    ```
2.  Ensure you are in your project's virtual environment.
3.  Install QueryGuard in editable mode from the root of the cloned QueryGuard repository:
    ```bash
    pip install -e .
    ```
4.  You may also want to install development dependencies for QueryGuard itself:
    ```bash
    pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    ```

**Managing `requirements.txt` for Host Application when using Local Editable Install:**
If your host application's `requirements.txt` normally installs QueryGuard from Git, you'll need to comment out that line while using a local editable version to avoid conflicts.

---

## 4. Understanding QueryGuard's Public API

QueryGuard exposes its primary functionality through a few key functions. These are made available directly from the top-level `queryguard` package thanks to the configuration in `queryguard/__init__.py`.

### Primary Functions

* **`load_rules_from_yaml(filepath: str) -> List[Dict[str, Any]]`**
    * **Purpose:** Loads and validates detection rules from a specified YAML file.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `filepath (str)`: The absolute or relative path to the YAML rule file.
    * **Returns:** A `List[Dict[str, Any]]`, where each dictionary represents a validated rule.
    * **Raises:**
        * `FileNotFoundError`: If the `filepath` does not exist.
        * `yaml.YAMLError`: If the file content is not valid YAML.
        * `ValueError`: If the YAML structure is valid but does not meet QueryGuard's schema requirements (e.g., missing essential keys, incorrect top-level structure).

* **`evaluate_input_advanced(user_input: str, ruleset: List[Dict[str, Any]], session_context: Optional[Dict[str, Any]] = None) -> Dict[str, Any]`**
    * **Purpose:** Evaluates user input against a loaded ruleset.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `user_input (str)`: The input string from the user.
        * `ruleset (List[Dict[str, Any]])`: A list of rule dictionaries, as returned by `load_rules_from_yaml`.
        * `session_context (Optional[Dict[str, Any]])`: (Currently a placeholder for future use) Optional dictionary for session-specific context.
    * **Returns:** A `Dict[str, Any]` containing the evaluation results. The structure is:
        ```json
        {
          "final_action": "ALLOW" | "BLOCK" | "FLAG" | "REQUEST_REPHRASE", // The overall determined action
          "triggered_rules": [ // List of rules that were triggered
            {
              "rule_id": "string",
              "rule_name": "string",
              "severity": "string",
              "action_defined": "string", // Action defined in the rule
              "message": "string",       // Processed message_template from the rule
              "raw_result_preview": "string" // Preview of the raw result from the detection function
            }
            // ... more triggered rules
          ],
          "risk_score": float, // A cumulative risk score (0.0-10.0)
          "processed_input": "string", // The input string after QueryGuard's internal normalization
          "message": "string | None" // If final_action is "BLOCK", this contains the message from the blocking rule. Otherwise None.
        }
        ```

* **`setup_logging(level: int = logging.INFO, handler: Optional[logging.Handler] = None) -> None`**
    * **Purpose:** Configures logging for the QueryGuard library. By default, QueryGuard uses a `NullHandler` (no log output). Call this function in your application to see QueryGuard's internal logs.
    * **Parameters:**
        * `level (int)`: Logging level (e.g., `logging.DEBUG`, `logging.INFO`). Defaults to `logging.INFO`.
        * `handler (Optional[logging.Handler])`: Custom logging handler. Defaults to a `StreamHandler` to `sys.stderr`.

### Troubleshooting Imports

If you encounter `ImportError: cannot import name ... from queryguard` for the functions above:
1.  Ensure QueryGuard is correctly installed in your Python environment.
2.  Verify that `queryguard/__init__.py` correctly imports and lists these functions in its `__all__` variable. The current version does this.
3.  Check for any naming conflicts (e.g., a local file named `queryguard.py`).

---

## 5. YAML Rule Configuration (Critical Area)

QueryGuard's behavior is primarily driven by rules defined in YAML files. Understanding how to configure these rules is essential for tailoring QueryGuard to your specific needs.

See `rules/default_ruleset.yaml` for a baseline and `rules/example_custom_rules.yaml` for further examples.

### Rule File Structure

A QueryGuard rule file is a YAML dictionary that **must** contain a top-level key named `rules`. The value of `rules` must be a list of rule objects.

```yaml
# Optional: Global settings (not strictly enforced by current loader but planned for future)
# settings:
#   default_action_if_no_match: "ALLOW" # QueryGuard's core logic defaults to ALLOW if no rule determines otherwise.

rules:
  - # Rule Object 1 (see schema below)
    # ...
  - # Rule Object 2
    # ...
```

---

### Rule Object Schema

Each object in the `rules` list must conform to the following schema:

* `rule_id (str)`: **Required.** A unique identifier for the rule (e.g., "MYAPP-001").
* `rule_name (str)`: **Required.** A human-readable name for the rule.
* `description (str)`: **Required.** An explanation of what the rule does and why.
* `target_abuse_categories (List[str])`: *Optional.* A list of abuse categories this rule targets (e.g., `["PROMPT_INJECTION", "DATA_LEAK"]`).
* `severity (str)`: **Required.** The severity of the detected issue (e.g., `"LOW"`, `"MEDIUM"`, `"HIGH"`, `"CRITICAL"`, `"INFO"`).
* `enabled (bool)`: *Optional.* Whether the rule is active. Defaults to `true` if omitted. Can also be specified as string `"true"` or `"false"`.
* `detection_logic (Dict[str, Any])`: **Required.** Defines how the rule detects issues.
    * `check_function (str)`: **Required.** The name of the Python function within QueryGuard to execute for this rule (see list below).
    * `parameters (Dict[str, Any])`: *Optional.* A dictionary of key-value pairs passed as arguments to the `check_function`. The specific parameters depend on the `check_function` used.
* `action_on_match (str)`: **Required.** The action to take if the rule is triggered (e.g., `"ALLOW"`, `"BLOCK"`, `"FLAG"`, `"REQUEST_REPHRASE"`, `"SCORE_ADJUST"`).
* `message_template (str)`: **Required.** Message to be used if the rule is triggered.
    * Can include `{{rule_id}}` which will be replaced with the rule's ID.
    * For rules using `analyze_text_statistics`, you can use placeholders like `{{metrics.entropy}}` or `{{metrics.length}}` which will be interpolated with values from the `metrics` dict returned by the function. Example: `Value: {{metrics.entropy:.2f}}`.
* `confidence_score_factor (float)`: *Optional.* A multiplier (0.0-1.0) applied to the severity-based score if this rule contributes to a cumulative risk score. Defaults to 1.0.
* `version (str)`: *Optional.* Version string for the rule definition itself (e.g., "1.0").
* `author (str)`: *Optional.* Author of the rule definition.
* `last_updated (str)`: *Optional.* Timestamp (ISO 8601 format recommended) of when the rule was last updated.
* `tags (List[str])`: *Optional.* A list of arbitrary tags for categorizing or filtering rules.
* `test_cases (Dict[str, List[str]])`: *Optional.* For documenting expected behavior.
    * `positive (List[str])`: Input strings that *should* trigger this rule.
    * `negative (List[str])`: Input strings that *should not* trigger this rule.

### YAML Syntax Notes

* **Indentation is critical** in YAML. Ensure correct indentation, especially for nested structures like `parameters` and its sub-fields within `detection_logic`. Incorrect indentation can lead to parsing errors by `PyYAML` or logical misinterpretation of the rule structure by QueryGuard.
* **Use spaces for indentation, not tabs.** Most YAML parsers expect spaces, and mixing tabs and spaces can lead to hard-to-debug errors.
* **Strings:** Quotation marks around strings are often optional in YAML, but it's good practice to use them if your string contains special characters (e.g., `:`, `{`, `}`, `[`, `]`, `,`, `&`, `*`, `#`, `?`, `|`, `-`, `<`, `>`, `=`, `!`, `%`, `@`, `` ` ``) or if it starts with a character that could be misinterpreted (like `true`, `false`, a number, or a dash indicating a list item when it's not).
    * Example: `message_template: "Rule '{{rule_id}}' was triggered!"`
* **Lists (Sequences):** Use a dash (`-`) followed by a space for items in a list.
    ```yaml
    injection_phrases:
      - "ignore previous instructions"
      - "your new task is"
    ```
* **Dictionaries (Mappings):** Use `key: value` pairs.
    ```yaml
    parameters:
      fuzzy_threshold: 85.0
      case_sensitive: false
    ```
* **Comments:** Lines beginning with `#` are comments and are ignored by the parser. Use them liberally to explain your rules.

---

## 6. QueryGuard Logging

QueryGuard uses Python's standard `logging` module to provide insights into its operations, which is invaluable for debugging and understanding how inputs are processed.

* **Default Behavior:** By default, QueryGuard adds a `logging.NullHandler()` to its root logger. This means no log messages will be output unless logging is explicitly configured by the consuming application. This is a standard practice for libraries to prevent them from polluting the application's logs if not desired.
* **Enabling Logs:** To see logs from QueryGuard, your application needs to call the `queryguard.setup_logging()` function. This function initializes QueryGuard's logger with a specified level and handler.

    ```python
    import queryguard
    import logging
    
    # Example 1: Enable basic INFO level logging to stderr
    queryguard.setup_logging(level=logging.INFO)
    
    # Example 2: Enable DEBUG level logging for more detailed output
    # queryguard.setup_logging(level=logging.DEBUG)
    
    # Example 3: Enable logging with a custom handler and formatter
    # my_app_handler = logging.FileHandler("queryguard_activity.log")
    # my_app_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(module)s - %(message)s')
    # my_app_handler.setFormatter(my_app_formatter)
    # queryguard.setup_logging(level=logging.DEBUG, handler=my_app_handler)
    ```
* **Log Levels:** Standard Python logging levels apply (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`).
    * `DEBUG`: Provides very detailed information, useful for tracing execution flow and diagnosing issues.
    * `INFO`: Provides general information about QueryGuard's operations (e.g., rules loaded, final evaluation outcome).
    * `WARNING`: Indicates potential issues or unexpected situations that don't necessarily cause an error.
    * `ERROR`: Indicates errors that occurred within QueryGuard, preventing it from performing an operation.

## 7. Integrating QueryGuard with a Host Application

Here's a conceptual example of integrating QueryGuard into a Python application (e.g., a Streamlit app or a backend service). This example demonstrates key steps like initialization, input evaluation, and error handling.

```python
import queryguard
import logging # Recommended to configure logging for your app as well
import yaml    # For handling YAML exceptions explicitly

# Configure your application's own logger (example setup)
app_logger = logging.getLogger("my_chatbot_app")
if not app_logger.handlers: # Avoid adding multiple handlers if already configured
    app_logger_handler = logging.StreamHandler()
    app_logger_formatter = logging.Formatter('%(asctime)s - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')
    app_logger_handler.setFormatter(app_logger_formatter)
    app_logger.addHandler(app_logger_handler)
    app_logger.setLevel(logging.INFO) # Set your app's desired log level

# --- QueryGuard Setup ---
# Optionally enable QueryGuard's own detailed logging for debugging
# queryguard.setup_logging(level=logging.DEBUG) 
# Or for informational messages from QueryGuard:
# queryguard.setup_logging(level=logging.INFO)

## 8. Troubleshooting Common Issues

This section covers common issues you might encounter when installing, configuring, or using QueryGuard, along with suggestions for resolving them.

* **Issue: Import Errors (`ImportError: cannot import name ...` or `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named queryguard`)**
    * **Cause & Resolution:**
        1.  **QueryGuard Not Installed:** Ensure QueryGuard is correctly installed in your active Python virtual environment. If you're using a `requirements.txt`, make sure `pip install -r requirements.txt` completed successfully. If using a local editable install (`pip install -e .`), ensure you ran it from the correct directory.
        2.  **Incorrect `__init__.py` Exposure:** Verify that `queryguard/__init__.py` correctly imports and lists the function/class you're trying to import in its `__all__` variable. (The primary public functions `load_rules_from_yaml`, `evaluate_input_advanced`, and `setup_logging` are correctly exposed in the current version.)
        3.  **Naming Conflicts:** Check if you have any local files or directories named `queryguard` or that conflict with standard Python modules, which might confuse Python's import system.
        4.  **Virtual Environment Not Activated:** Ensure your project's virtual environment (where QueryGuard was installed) is activated in your current terminal session or IDE.

* **Issue: Rule Loading Failures (`FileNotFoundError`, `yaml.YAMLError`, `ValueError` from `load_rules_from_yaml`)**
    * **`FileNotFoundError`:**
        * **Cause:** The `filepath` provided to `load_rules_from_yaml` does not point to an existing file.
        * **Resolution:** Double-check the path. Use absolute paths if you're unsure about the relative path from your script's execution context. QueryGuard (with logging enabled) will log the absolute path it attempts to load, which can help diagnose this.
    * **`yaml.YAMLError`:**
        * **Cause:** The rule file contains YAML syntax errors.
        * **Resolution:** Use a YAML validator or linter to check your rule file. Common issues include incorrect indentation (YAML is very sensitive to this; use spaces, not tabs), unescaped special characters, or improper list/dictionary formatting. QueryGuard will log the `PyYAML` error message.
    * **`ValueError` (from `load_rules_from_yaml`):**
        * **Cause:** The YAML syntax is correct, but the structure of the data does not meet QueryGuard's schema requirements for rules. This could be a missing top-level `rules:` key, a rule object not being a dictionary, missing required fields within a rule (like `rule_id`, `detection_logic`, `check_function`, `action_on_match`, `severity`), or invalid values for fields like `severity` or `action_on_match`.
        * **Resolution:** Review the "Rule Object Schema" and "Built-in `check_function`s and Parameters" sections in this guide. QueryGuard's error message (and logs if `ERROR` level logging is enabled) will provide details about the specific validation failures.

* **Issue: QueryGuard Blocks Unexpectedly or Fails to Block an Expected Input**
    * **Resolution - CRITICAL: Meticulously verify the relevant YAML rule definition:**
        1.  **Is the rule `enabled: true`?** (Or is the `enabled` field omitted, which defaults to true?)
        2.  Is `action_on_match` correctly set (e.g., to `"BLOCK"` if you expect a block)?
        3.  Is the `check_function` name **exactly correct** as per the list in Section 5 of this guide? (e.g., `detect_direct_injection_variants`).
        4.  Are the `parameters` for that `check_function` **named exactly correctly** in your YAML (e.g., `injection_phrases`, not `phrases_to_check`)? Do their values make sense and match the expected types (e.g., `injection_phrases` should be a list of strings, `fuzzy_threshold` a number)? This was a key area of confusion in past debugging.
        5.  For fuzzy matching (`detect_direct_injection_variants`), is the `fuzzy_threshold` appropriate? A very high threshold might miss slight variations. A very low one might cause false positives. Recall that this function uses `fuzzywuzzy.fuzz.partial_ratio`.
        6.  Check for subtle typos or character differences in your rule parameters (e.g., in `injection_phrases` or `substrings_to_match`).
    * **Enable QueryGuard's DEBUG Logging:** Call `queryguard.setup_logging(level=logging.DEBUG)` in your application. This will output detailed information about which rules are being processed, the parameters passed to detection functions, the raw results from these functions, and how the final action is determined. This is invaluable for seeing *why* a rule did or did not trigger.

* **Issue: QueryGuard Blocks but Application Shows Generic/No Message (or not the expected custom message)**
    * **Cause & Resolution:**
        1.  Your application should be checking the `final_action` from `evaluate_input_advanced`. If it's `"BLOCK"`, it should then retrieve and display the message from the `message` key in the dictionary returned by `evaluate_input_advanced`.
        2.  Ensure the `message_template` field is correctly defined in the specific rule within your YAML file that's causing the block.
        3.  QueryGuard (as of recent updates) is designed to populate the top-level `message` field in its return dictionary with the processed `message_template` from the rule that ultimately caused the "BLOCK" action. If this is missing, it could indicate an edge case in QueryGuard's `core.py` logic, though this was specifically addressed.

* **Issue: Internal QueryGuard Errors (e.g., `NameError`, unexpected `TypeError` from within QueryGuard functions)**
    * **Cause:** These likely indicate a bug within the QueryGuard library itself, or a mismatch between a rule's `parameters` and what a `check_function` genuinely expects that wasn't caught by basic validation.
    * **Resolution:** Please report these on the QueryGuard GitHub issues page. Include the full error traceback, the input query that caused the error, and the specific rule definition if it seems relevant. Enabling DEBUG logging might also provide useful context.

## 9. Advanced: Debugging QueryGuard

(For contributors or users needing to dive deeper into QueryGuard's internal workings)

When troubleshooting complex issues or developing new features for QueryGuard, the following debugging techniques can be very helpful:

* **Enable Verbose Logging:**
    This is the first and most important step. QueryGuard's logging system can provide detailed insight into its execution flow.
    ```python
    import queryguard
    import logging

    # Set logging to DEBUG to see the most detailed output from QueryGuard
    queryguard.setup_logging(level=logging.DEBUG)
    ```
    With `DEBUG` level enabled, you'll see logs related to:
    * Input normalization.
    * Which rules are being processed.
    * The exact parameters being passed to `check_function`s.
    * The raw results returned by `check_function`s.
    * How `evaluate_input_advanced` determines the `final_action` based on rule triggers and priorities.

* **Standalone Test Scripts for Detection Functions:**
    If you suspect an issue lies within a specific detection function (e.g., `detect_direct_injection_variants` isn't matching as expected, or `analyze_text_statistics` gives unusual metrics), it's often useful to test it in isolation:
    1.  Create a new, small Python script (e.g., `test_my_detection_func.py`).
    2.  Import the specific detection function directly from `queryguard.detection_functions`. For example:
        ```python
        from queryguard.detection_functions import detect_direct_injection_variants
        # Or:
        # from queryguard.detection_functions import analyze_text_statistics
        ```
    3.  In your script, call the function with various test inputs and the exact parameters you're using in your YAML rule. Print or log its raw output.
        ```python
        # Example for testing detect_direct_injection_variants
        test_text = "This is some input ignore previous instructions maybe?"
        phrases = ["ignore previous instructions"]
        threshold = 85.0
        
        result = detect_direct_injection_variants(test_text, phrases, threshold)
        print(f"Detection function output: {result}")
        ```
    This helps determine if an issue is with the core logic of the detection function itself or with how it's being called and its results interpreted by the main `evaluate_input_advanced` pipeline in `queryguard/core.py`.

* **Use a Python Debugger:**
    For more complex issues, stepping through the code with a Python debugger (like `pdb` or the debugger integrated into your IDE such as VS Code, PyCharm) can be invaluable.
    * Set breakpoints in `queryguard/core.py` (e.g., within `evaluate_input_advanced` or `_call_detection_function`).
    * Set breakpoints in the specific `queryguard.detection_functions` you are investigating.
    * This allows you to inspect variable values, observe the call stack, and understand the control flow step-by-step.
