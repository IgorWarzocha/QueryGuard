"""
QueryGuard: A pre-LLM input filtering and validation library.

This library provides tools to detect and mitigate common abuse patterns,
off-topic queries, resource exhaustion attempts, and basic instruction
bypassing before a query is sent to a primary Large Language Model (LLM).

# Make key components available for easier import, e.g.:
# from queryguard import evaluate, load_rules
# We'll populate this further as we define these functions.

__version__ = "0.0.1-alpha" # Initial version

# Placeholder for now, will be populated with core function imports
# from .core import evaluate_input_advanced
# from .rule_loader import load_rules_from_yaml

print("QueryGuard package loaded (alpha version)") # Optional: for initial dev feedback
