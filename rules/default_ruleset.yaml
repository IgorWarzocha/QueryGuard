# QueryGuard Default Ruleset
# Version: 1.1.0
# Last Updated: 2025-05-30 (Updated during rework)
# Description: A baseline set of rules to detect common and some advanced
#              LLM abuse patterns, based on QueryGuard's detection capabilities.
#              This ruleset is intended as a starting point and should be
#              customized and tested for specific application needs.

# Global settings for the ruleset (Optional section, not strictly enforced by current loader but good for future)
# settings:
#   default_action_if_no_match: "ALLOW" # Default QueryGuard behavior is ALLOW if no rule triggers a different action.
