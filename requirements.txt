# Core dependencies for QueryGuard
PyYAML>=5.0  # For loading YAML rule files
fuzzywuzzy>=0.18.0 # For fuzzy string matching
python-Levenshtein>=0.12.2 # Improves speed of fuzzywuzzy (often a dependency of fuzzywuzzy)

# unicodedata2>=13.0.0 # Commented out: Python's built-in unicodedata is generally sufficient
                     # for NFKC normalization on modern Python 3 versions.
                     # Add back if specific advanced Unicode features are needed that
                     # built-in unicodedata doesn't cover well.
